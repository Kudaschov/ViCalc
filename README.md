# ViCalc

ViCalc is an open-source scientific Python calculator designed for efficient touch typing with output recording. It combines the simplicity of a traditional calculator with the power of a PC, allowing users to perform calculations without leaving the keyboard.

## Key Features

- Touch-Typing Optimized: Keys are split for left-hand (left keyboard side) and right-hand (right side or numeric keypad) operation, enabling fast ten-finger typing.
- Mouse Support: Use the mouse for a traditional calculator experience.
- Cross-Platform: Runs on any system with Python.
- Open Source: Contributions are welcome to add new features!

## History

Originating in 2003, ViCalc was rewritten in Python to modernize it. It was created to address the need for a tool that integrates coding and calculations, supporting ten-finger typing for academic and professional tasks like mathematical modeling.
