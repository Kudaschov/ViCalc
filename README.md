## Key Features

- Touch-Typing Optimized: Keys are split for left-hand (left keyboard side) and right-hand (right side or numeric keypad) operation, enabling fast ten-finger typing.
- Calculation History: Automatically records output, allowing you to review or reuse past calculations.
- Mouse Support: Use the mouse for a traditional calculator experience.
- Cross-Platform: Runs on any system with Python.
- Open Source: Contributions are welcome to add new features!

## History

Originating in 2003, ViCalc was rewritten in Python to modernize it. It was created to address the need for a tool that integrates coding and calculations, supporting ten-finger typing for academic and professional tasks like mathematical modeling.
